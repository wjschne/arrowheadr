* This is a new release.

As recommended in a note from Beni Altmann on 2024-06-06, I have made the following changes since the previous submission:

* I have added more details in the Description field at about what the package does.
* In the Description field, I have enclosed the names of packages in single quotes.
* I removed all use of `par` in my functions and examples.
