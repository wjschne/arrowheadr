Description: The 'ggarrow' package is a 'ggplot2' extension that plots
    a variety of different arrow segments with many options to customize. 
    The 'arrowheadr' package makes it easy to create custom arrowheads 
    and fins within the parameters that 'ggarrow' functions expect. It 
    has preset arrowheads and a collection of functions to create and 
    transform data for customizing arrows.
